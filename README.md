# What is it?

This is very light application launcher (or home screen) for Mocor-based cell phones. It seems like they are getting popular and you can buy it from TaoBao or AliExpress in 2019-2023 year.
But both versions of stock launcher are somewhat lacks functionality and aren't animated at all. I'm using BlackBerry Z30 as my primary phone, so i like smooth experience
and deicded to create this laucher and share it with everyone :)

# Why it's better than stock launcher?

+ Fully smooth animated
+ Task manager
# Hotkeys
+ Left (menu key) - Files
+ Right (back key) - contacts
+ D-pad right - Calendar
+ D-pad left - Messages
+ D-pad down - Status bar
+ D-pad up - Task manager
# To-do list
+ Open apps from task manager
+ Remove apps from task manager
+ Show app name in task manager (in hebrew)
+ Option to customize the hotkeys/apps in the menu
