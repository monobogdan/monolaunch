# What is it?

This is very light application launcher (or home screen) for Mocor-based cell phones. It seems like they are getting popular and you can buy it from TaoBao or AliExpress in 2019-2023 year.
But both versions of stock launcher are somewhat lacks functionality and aren't animated at all. I'm using BlackBerry Z30 as my primary phone, so i like smooth experience
and deicded to create this laucher and share it with everyone :)

# Why it's better than stock launcher?

+ Fully smooth animated
+ Task manager
